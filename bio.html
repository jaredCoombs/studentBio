   <p>
     From Preston, Idaho. Moved to Oregon. Joined the Army after High School. Served in Bosnia in 1996. In 1998, I wanted to change jobs from truck mechanic to heavy equipment mechanic, was denied, so I joined the Navy (Seabees). Served in Iraq in 2003. I currrently work as a Locomotive mechanic. I'm changing careers to web developent because I'm ready for new challenges, and I need a career that I can pysically do until retirement.
